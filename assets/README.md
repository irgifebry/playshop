# Assets

## Global site logo

Place your website logo at:

- `assets/logo.png`

The UI (navbar logo icon) is wired to use this image via CSS (`css/style.css`) so it applies across **all pages** (including admin pages).

Notes:
- Recommended size: 256x256 or larger (square), PNG with transparent background if possible.
- After replacing the file, do a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to bypass browser cache.
